# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to extract insights and build predictive models. The project follows a structured ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, demonstrating expertise in data transformation, feature engineering, and model optimization.

## Project Details

- **Scenario:** This project addresses a real-world problem using structured datasets and machine learning techniques.
- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model that extracts meaningful insights, identifies patterns, and improves decision-making.

## Workflow & Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Imported raw data from CSV/SQL/API.
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Applied feature engineering (encoding, normalization, transformation).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends.
   - Identified key features influencing model performance.

3. **Model Development**
   - Implemented multiple ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

4. **Evaluation & Optimization**
   - Used key metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
   - Applied cross-validation and feature selection techniques.

5. **Deployment & Visualization**
   - Presented results via interactive dashboards.
   - Explored cloud deployment using AWS/GCP for scalability.
